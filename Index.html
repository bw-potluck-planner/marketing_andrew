            <h1>Eat, Plan, Potluck</h1>
            <p>"America, it has been observed, is not really a melting pot. It is actually a huge potluck dinner, in
                which platters
                of roasted chicken beckon beside casseroles of pasta, mounds of tortillas, stew pots of gumbo, and
                skillets filled
                with pilafs of every imaginable color."

                We all love to eat right? As Guy Fieri once said"Cooking is all about people. Food is maybe the only
                universal thing
                that really has the power to bring everyone together. No matter what culture, everywhere around the
                world, people eat
                together." Which is why we should plan it!

                On Potluck day there is no stress. Sit back and relax with all the people you love. You already know
                what everyone is
                bringing. Enjoy the beautiful tastes and smells of dishes filled with love that your family and freinds
                brought to
                share!

                    Create an amazing menu. This way nobody brings the same dish. When you accept the invite you get to
                    choose the dish
                    you want to bring. Or if your feeling brave you can random pick!

                    Invite all the best cooks to your Potluck. Once invited they can pick a dish from the list. First
                    come First serve
                    so dont be that guy! You can send Invites to email, sms, or by profile. Enjoy deliciousness!

                    You Can't show up to the Potluck with just a fork! If I think about Potlucks one item stands out
                    above the rest. Can
                    you guess what it is? Thats right a Crockpot! If your Crockpot game is slackin, step it up before it
                    so late. It
                    could be the difference between a one time event and a new tradition.
